Some weights of EsmForSequenceClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at facebook/esm2_t6_8M_UR50D and are newly initialized: ['classifier.dense.bias', 'classifier.dense.weight', 'classifier.out_proj.bias', 'classifier.out_proj.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
